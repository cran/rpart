\title{
  Create Split Labels For an Rpart Object 
}
\description{
  This function provides labels for the branches of an \code{rpart} tree.
}
\usage{
\method{labels}{rpart}(object, digits = 4, minlength = 1L, pretty, collapse = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{
  fitted model object of class \code{"rpart"}.  This is assumed to be the
  result of some function that produces an object with the same named
  components as that returned by the \code{rpart} function.
}
\item{digits}{
  the number of digits to be used for numeric values.  
  All of the \code{rpart} functions that call labels
  explicitly set this value, with \code{options("digits")}
  as the default.
}
\item{minlength}{
  the minimum length for abbreviation of character or factor variables.
  If \code{0} no abbreviation is done; if \code{1} single English letters are
  used, first lower case than upper case (with a maximum of 52
  levels). If the value is greater than \code{}, the \code{\link{abbreviate}}
  function is used, passed the \code{minlength} argument.
}
\item{pretty}{
  an argument included for compatibility with the original Splus tree package:
  \code{pretty = 0} implies \code{minlength = 0L},
  \code{pretty = NULL} implies \code{minlength = 1L}, and
  \code{pretty = TRUE} implies \code{minlength = 4L}.
}
\item{collapse}{
  logical. The returned set of labels is always of the same length as
  the number of nodes in the tree.
  
  If \code{collapse = TRUE} (default), 
  the returned value is a vector of labels for the branch leading into
  each node, with \code{"root"} as the label for the top node.

  If \code{FALSE}, the returned value is a two
  column matrix of labels for the left and right branches leading 
  out from each node, with \code{"leaf"} as the branch labels for terminal
  nodes.
}
\item{\dots}{optional arguments to \code{abbreviate}.}
}
\value{

  Vector of split labels (\code{collapse = TRUE}) or matrix of left and
  right splits (\code{collapse = FALSE}) for the supplied \code{rpart}
  object.  This function is called by printing methods for \code{rpart}
  and is not intended to be called directly by the users.
